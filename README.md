In this project, I used several different Python libraries. They include the following:
    1. Matplotlib
    2. Pandas
    3. Seaborn
    4. Sklearn
    5. NumPy
    
The motivation for this project is that we want to look at the AirBnB listing data for Seattle. We are going to analyze from many different angles. Some questions we are asking include the following: 
    1. What are the most expensive neighborhoods in Seattle
    2. Which factors are strongly correlated with each other?
    3. What are the average review scores
    4. What factors affect pricing the most for properties. (Build a model)
The files in the repository include a csv file of all the listing data and the Juypter Notebook to run the code

The findings I found after doing this project are the most expensive neighborhoods in Seattle which was the Magnoalia neighborhood, the neighborhoods with the highest review score rating which was the Central Area neighborhood, and qualities/attributes that affect pricing the most which include the property type being a dorm, and correlation between different qualities/attributes of an AirBnB listing.
